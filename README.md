# About the plotter:
The plotter is a python program, which plots the data using the matplotlib library.

You will need to install python if you haven't already.  When you're installing it, be sure to check the "Add to PATH" option or "Add to Environment Variables".  It's something like that.

To install matplotlib, run `pip install matplotlib` in your terminal.

Then you can run the python program with `py plotter.py`.

The program will attempt to read `output.txt`, which is generated by the c++ program, so run the c++ program first.

The output file has 3 sections
- `Sensors`: the sensor locations
- `Chosen`: the chosen sensors
- `R`: The radius of each sensor

I will post an example of this file under `output_example.txt`
